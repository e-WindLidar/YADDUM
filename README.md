# YADDUM - Yet Another Dual-Doppler Uncertainty Model

Yes, true, all of us have their own uncertainty models! <br>
<br> However, when you need an operational uncertainty model (i.e., a piece of code that you can simply run) there is none available to you. Usually models people have are either buried deep inside some tools which are proprietary or people simply don't want to share their work. Alternatively, you are directed to read a bunch of hard to understand scientific papers which have a large number of equations and somewhat dry and formal text that explain them, thus their reproducibility isn't that great! <br>

But we don't want either of that, we want reproducible and reusable results which are freely shared and are explained in a simple way enabling not only 'regular' but also citizen science. That's way I made this project. 
<br><br> This project is focused on developing a simple yet effective dual-Doppler uncertainty model. It is based on the work of Nikola Vasiljevic and Michael Courtney which has been presented on several occasions, e.g. :

<br> I use Python, since I believe that researchers and developers should not be enchained in commercial development environments such as Matlab or Mathematica which rip profit from the hard working people.
